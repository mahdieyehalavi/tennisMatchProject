**Script of Scripts (SoS)** consists of [`SoS Notebook`](https://github.com/vatlab/sos-notebook), a Jupyter-based polyglot notebook that allows the use of multiple Jupyter kernels in one notebook, and
[`SoS Workflow`](https://github.com/vatlab/sos), a workflow system for the execution of workflows in both process- and outcome-oriented styles. It is designed for data scientists and bioinformatics who routinely work with scripts in different languages such as bash, Python, R, and SAS. This repository contains the `SoS Workflow` workflow engine.

Please refer to relevant publications [SoS Notebook: An Interactive Multi-Language Data Analysis Environment](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty405/5001386
) in Bioinformatics, [Script of Scripts: a pragmatic workflow system for daily computational research](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006843) in PLoS Computational Biology, and the [SoS homepage](http://vatlab.github.io/sos-docs) for more information on SoS Notebook and SoS Workflow.

We welcome and value community contributions: please [post issues](https://github.com/vatlab/SoS/issues)
to provide us feedback or get our support; please [send pull requests](https://github.com/vatlab/SoS/pulls)
if you have helped fixing bugs or making improvements to the source code. In addition, if you are interesting in extending SoS, for example adding a new target type or task engine, please have a look at our tutorial on extending SoS [here](https://vatlab.github.io/sos-docs/doc/user_guide/extending_sos.html).

# Installing SoS Workflow and Notebook

* If you are using conda, you can install sos using command

  ```bash
  conda install sos -c conda-forge
  ```
  You can also install a majority of the SoS suite of tools using commands such as
  ```bash
  conda install sos sos-pbs sos-notebook jupyterlab-sos sos-bash sos-python sos-r -c conda-forge
  ```
  This will install SoS Workflow, SoS Notebook and its JupyterLab extension, language modules for
  `Bash`, `Python2`, `Python3`, `R`, `R` itself (`r-base` and `r-irkernel` etc) and needed
  libraries (e.g. `feather`) if needed.

* If you are not using conda, you will have to install all the pieces one by one, but you will also have the freedom to use non-conda installation of `R`, `Julia` etc. With a working Python 3.6 installation, you can install SoS Workflow with command

  ```bash
  pip install sos
  ```
  and also
  ```bash
  pip install sos-pbs
  ```
  if you would like to use SoS with a remote batch system such as LSF or Slurm.

  You can install SoS Notebook, and register the sos kernel with Jupyter using the following commands

  ```bash
  pip install sos-notebook
  python -m sos_notebook.install
  ```

  To exchange data between live kernels in SoS Notebook, you will need to install individual kernels (e.g. `irkernel` for `R`), make sure they work under Jupyter, and install SoS language modules using commands such as

  ```bash
  pip install sos-r sos-matlab sos-python sos-bash
  ```
  Different modules might be needed to assist data exchange among kernels. Please refer to [the installation page of sos website](https://vatlab.github.io/sos-docs/#runningsos) for details.
